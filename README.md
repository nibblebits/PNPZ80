# PNPZ80

PNPZ80 stands for Plug N Play Z80. PNPZ80 is a library that will allow you to create emulators that simulate the Z80 processor simply. Using PNPZ80 you can add your own virtual hardware that you have created.

The best way to describe PNPZ80 is that its like someone giving you a Z80 Processor and possibly some built in virtual hardware that you need to build the system you want and then leaving you to do the programming. Any hardware that is not in the core you can make yourself.

Feel free to contribute to the project, at the moment the important part is finishing the Z80 simulator.

#Compiling notes:
To compile on windows use "make windows" to compile on linux use "make linux". Be sure to firstly clean the project by using "make cleanWindows" or "make cleanLinux" depending on your operating system.
